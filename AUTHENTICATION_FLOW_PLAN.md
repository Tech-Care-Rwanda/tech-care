# TechCare Authentication Flow - Fix & Implementation Plan

## 🚨 **Current Critical Issues**

### **Authentication State Problems**
- **Wrong User Profile Loading**: Login redirects to incorrect user profile (John Uwimana) instead of the actual authenticated user
- **Broken Sign Out**: Sign out functionality is non-functional
- **Profile Creation Inconsistency**: Disconnect between user signup and profile creation in database

### **User Experience Problems**
- **No Clear User Flow**: Missing proper login/signup → dashboard progression
- **Mixed Anonymous/Auth States**: Confusion between anonymous browsing and authenticated user experiences  
- **No Role-Based Routing**: Customers and technicians end up in same interface
- **Navigation Inconsistency**: Navigation bar doesn't reflect authentication state properly

### **Booking System Problems**
- **Booking Creation Bug**: Confirmed bookings not appearing in Active Bookings dashboard
- **API Route Error**: NextJS params not awaited in `/api/bookings/customer/[customerId]` route
- **Missing Avatar Images**: 404 errors for `/images/default-avatar.jpg`

---

## 🎯 **PHASE 1: Core Authentication Fixes**

### **Priority: CRITICAL - Must Fix First**

#### **1.1 Profile Fetching Investigation**
- **Issue**: Authentication system loading wrong user profile
- **Investigation Areas**: 
  - Profile lookup mechanism
  - User ID matching between auth and database
  - Session management and state persistence
  - Default/cached data handling

#### **1.2 Sign Out Functionality**
- **Issue**: Sign out does not properly clear authentication state
- **Scope**: Complete logout flow including state cleanup and redirection

#### **1.3 Signup-to-Profile Pipeline** 
- **Issue**: Potential disconnect between user registration and profile creation
- **Scope**: End-to-end user creation process validation

#### **1.4 Critical Database & RLS Issues** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Users table schema using integer ID instead of UUID - **FIXED**
- **Issue**: Row Level Security policies missing - **FIXED** 
- **Issue**: Profile creation failing due to missing ID field - **FIXED**
- **Issue**: NavigationBar hydration mismatch - **FIXED**
- **Issue**: NextJS API route params not properly awaited - **FIXED**

#### **1.5 Critical Booking System Fixes**
- **Issue**: Confirmed bookings not appearing in Active Bookings dashboard
- **Issue**: Missing default avatar images causing 404 errors
- **Scope**: Fix booking creation pipeline and API route errors

## 🎯 **PHASE 2: User Flow Architecture Design** ✅ COMPLETED

### **Priority: HIGH - Foundation for User Experience**

#### **2.1 Landing Page Logic** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Previous State**: Shows hardcoded user data regardless of authentication
**Current State**: Dynamic experience based on authentication status

```
✅ Anonymous Users:
- Browse technicians and services with clear UI indicators
- Prominent calls-to-action for registration/login in hero section
- Service booking buttons redirect to signup for account creation
- Registration prompt banner in sidebar encouraging account creation

✅ Authenticated Users:  
- Personalized welcome message with user's first name
- Direct access to dashboard with "View My Bookings" button
- Role-appropriate service booking functionality
- No signup prompts or registration banners
```

#### **2.2 Authentication Flow Structure** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
Clear paths established for:
- **Discovery**: Anonymous browsing → registration motivation through value props
- **Registration**: Signup → profile creation → role-based dashboard routing  
- **Authentication**: Login → automatic role-based dashboard routing
- **Session Management**: Supabase integration with proper state handling across navigation

#### **2.3 Role-Based Routing Implementation** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
Distinct user journeys established:
- **Customers**: `/dashboard` - Booking-focused dashboard with service management
- **Technicians**: `/technician/dashboard` - Job management and availability control
- **Admins**: `/admin/dashboard` - User and system management interfaces (placeholder)

**Protected Route Components**:
- `ProtectedRoute` component with role-based access control
- `CustomerRoute`, `TechnicianRoute`, `AdminRoute` for specific role protection
- Applied to all dashboard pages to prevent unauthorized access

2. **Session Flow Analysis**: Map actual vs expected user journey
3. **Database Relationship Verification**: Confirm auth-to-profile connections

### **Incremental Implementation**
1. **Fix Immediate Blockers**: Get basic auth working correctly
2. **Establish Clear Flows**: Implement role-based routing
3. **Enhance User Experience**: Add proper loading states and error handling
4. **Polish Interface**: Ensure consistent navigation and branding

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Multi-User Testing**: Verify each role works independently
- **Flow Testing**: Complete user journeys from anonymous to authenticated
- **State Management Testing**: Proper session handling across app navigation

## 📝 **Developer Handoff Notes**

### **Investigation Starting Points**
- Review current authentication context and state management
- Examine profile fetching logic and database queries
- Test signup process end-to-end with fresh user accounts

### **Key Questions to Explore**
- How is the current user profile determined after login?
- What triggers the default "John Uwimana" profile display?
- Are Supabase Auth user IDs correctly mapped to database profiles?
- How does session persistence work across page navigation?

### **Testing Recommendations**
- Create fresh test users to verify signup-to-login flow
- Test authentication with multiple browsers/incognito sessions  
- Verify database profile creation during user registration
- Test role-based routing with different user types

This plan provides structure while allowing implementation flexibility and independent problem-solving approaches.
