# üöÄ Developer Handoff - TechCare Rwanda

## üìç **Current Status** 
**Map Integration Phase: ‚úÖ COMPLETE** | **Next Phase: üìÖ Booking System**

---

## üéØ **What You're Taking Over**

**TechCare Rwanda** - A booking platform connecting customers with tech support services in Rwanda. You're continuing development on a **4-week roadmap** where **Week 1 (Map Integration) is complete**.

---

## ‚úÖ **What's Already Done (Week 1)**

### **Core Features Implemented:**
- **Google Places API Integration** - Discovers real computer shops in Kigali
- **Interactive Map System** - Professional Google Maps integration with business markers
- **Search Results Redesign** - Real business cards instead of fake technician data
- **Data Management** - React hooks for shop data, loading states, error handling
- **Bug Fixes** - Resolved infinite loop causing app crashes

### **Key Files Created:**
```
frontend/src/lib/services/googlePlaces.ts      # API service
frontend/src/lib/hooks/useComputerShops.ts     # Data hooks  
frontend/src/components/maps/BaseMap.tsx       # Map wrapper
frontend/src/components/maps/MapMarker.tsx     # Custom markers
frontend/src/app/search-results/page.tsx       # Updated UI
frontend/docs/MAP_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md          # Full specs
```

### **Current App State:**
- ‚úÖ **Fully functional** with real Google Places data (API keys provided in .env.local)
- ‚úÖ **Stable rendering** - infinite loop bug fixed
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** map integration showing real Kigali computer shops
- ‚úÖ **Booking frontend working** - visit http://localhost:3001/dashboard/book/mock_1

## üéØ **Your Mission: Backend Integration & Issue Resolution**

### **MANDATORY FIRST STEP:**
**Before starting ANY development, you MUST:**
1. **Check GitHub Issues** using MCP tools - `mcp_GitHub_list_issues`
2. **Review the complete backlog** and understand all pending tasks
3. **Get user approval** for your planned approach
4. **Work issue by issue** systematically until backlog is empty

### **Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Frontend booking system** - Complete UI for service selection, details, etc.
- ‚ùå **Backend booking system** - Not connected/working yet
- üéØ **Focus** - Make backend handle booking requests properly

### **Technical Priorities:**
```typescript
// Backend focus - Frontend already exists:
- Backend booking endpoints   # POST /api/bookings
- Database booking models     # JPA entities  
- Email/SMS notifications     # Spring Boot integration
- Booking status management   # Confirmed/Pending/Cancelled
- Technician assignment logic # Auto/manual assignment
```

### **Workflow Process:**
```bash
# 1. ALWAYS start with backlog review
mcp_GitHub_list_issues --owner Tech-Care-Rwanda --repo tech-care

# 2. Get approval for approach
# 3. Work systematically through issues
# 4. Update issue status as you complete tasks
```

## üìö **Essential Context**

### **Project Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot (authentication ready)
- **Database:** JPA repositories for Admin, Customer, Technician
- **Maps:** Google Maps JavaScript API + Places API

### **User Roles:**
- **Customers:** Book tech services, view shops
- **Technicians:** Receive bookings, manage schedules  
- **Admins:** Manage categories, pricing, system config

### **Admin Dependencies:**
- ‚úÖ **Google Cloud API Key** - Provided and working in .env.local
- ‚è≥ **Service Categories & Pricing** - May need refinement based on issues
- ‚è≥ **Payment Gateway Setup** - MTN/Airtel Mobile Money (future phase)

---

## üöÄ **Quick Start Commands**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev                    # Start development server
npm run build                  # Test production build
```

**Environment Setup:**
```bash
# .env.local (when admin provides API key)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

---

## üìñ **Key Documentation**

- **`MAP_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`** - Complete technical specifications
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`** - Detailed session summary  
- **`BUG_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** - Infinite loop fix documentation

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **MANDATORY GitHub Workflow** - ALWAYS check issues first, get approval, work systematically
2. **No Breaking Changes** - App is stable, avoid touching core map integration  
3. **Backend Focus** - Frontend booking UI works, backend doesn't connect yet
4. **Issue-Driven Development** - Complete GitHub backlog systematically
5. **Test Live Booking Flow** - http://localhost:3001/dashboard/book/mock_1

---

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

- ‚úÖ All GitHub issues reviewed and planned approach approved
- ‚úÖ Backend booking endpoints working (POST /api/bookings)
- ‚úÖ Database models for booking management created
- ‚úÖ Frontend-backend booking integration complete
- ‚úÖ Email/SMS notifications working
- ‚úÖ GitHub backlog cleared (no open issues)

**Previous Developer:** Successfully delivered Week 1 ahead of schedule  
**Next Developer:** Continue the momentum with booking system! üöÄ

*Good luck! The foundation is solid - build something amazing.* ‚≠ê
