## 🚨 FRONTEND ISSUES & FIXES NEEDED (Immediate)

### 🔴 Homepage Critical Issues:
1. ✅ **Search Toolbar Dropdowns Not Working**: FIXED - Location, Service Type, Urgency dropdowns now fully functional  
2. ✅ **Hamburger Menu Non-Functional**: FIXED - Mobile navigation menu now fully functional 
3. ✅ **Globe Icon Not Working**: FIXED - Language switcher properly connected 
4. ✅ **Profile Icon Not Working**: FIXED - User profile dropdown implemented 
5. **Service Cards Wrong Linking**: All cards link to generic search results instead of specific service detail pages
6. **"Ask a Supertechnician" Section Incomplete**: Needs actual technician profiles and messaging functionality
7. **Footer Links Broken**: All footer links need proper routing to actual pages

### 🔴 Search Results Page Critical Issues:
8. **Filter Visual Indicators Missing**: No clear visual feedback for active filters
9. **Information Overload**: Too much unnecessary information cluttering the interface
10. **Map Feature Non-Functional**: Map integration needs real API implementation (Google Maps/MapBox)
11. **Technician Names Not Clear**: "Book now" cards don't clearly display technician names
12. **Filter Functionality Broken**: Both top search bar and right sidebar filters don't work
13. **Filter UX Needs Redesign**: Current filter system is confusing and needs simplification

### 🔴 Missing Pages:
14. **"Become a Technician" Page**: Needs complete design and implementation
15. **Individual Service Detail Pages**: Dedicated pages for each service type with technician listings
16. **Supertechnician Profile Pages**: Individual profiles with messaging capability

## 🚧 PENDING ITEMS - Current Gaps

### Pages Referenced But Not Implemented:
**Status:** Links exist in navigation but pages not built
- **About Page**: Company information, team, mission
- **How It Works** (separate page): Referenced in footer/navigation  
- **Help Center/FAQ** (separate page): Referenced but content integrated in Learn page
- **Contact Page**: Support contact forms and information
- **Legal Pages**: Terms, Privacy Policy, etc.

### Authentication Integration Gap:
**Status:** Backend ready, frontend exists as static HTML
- **HTML to Next.js Conversion**: Login/register pages exist in `/frontend/public/` as static HTML
- **Frontend-Backend Connection**: No API integration between React components and Spring Boot backend
- **Authentication Flow**: Dashboard requires proper login/session management
- **Route Protection**: Auth guards not implemented for protected routes

### Backend-Frontend Integration:
**Status:** Both exist independently, not connected
- **API Integration**: Frontend uses mock data, not connected to Spring Boot APIs
- **CORS Configuration**: Backend needs frontend URL allowlist
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management between systems
- **Data Fetching**: Replace mock data with actual API calls
