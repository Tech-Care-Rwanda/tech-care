**Our Core Goal:** To create a stable, end-to-end experience where a Customer can find, view, and book a Technician, and the Technician can see and manage that booking. This plan fixes all known UI bugs and implements the core technician profile feature.

#### **Step 1: Build the Core Data Connection in progress**

* **Problem:** This is the most important issue. There is no reliable data link between what a technician does and what a customer sees. A new technician signs up but doesn't appear for customers. A customer books a job, but the technician never sees it. The system is disconnected.
* **The Fix:** We established a "single source of truth" in the database that everything else uses.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: When a new **Technician** signs up, a row is now created in the `users` table in Supabase with their details and proper role. 
    * ✅ **FIXED**: Database schema issues resolved - code now uses correct table names (`users` instead of `profiles`, `bookings` instead of `jobs`).
    * ✅ **FIXED**: Column name mismatch resolved - authentication now uses `users.id` correctly instead of non-existent `user_id` column.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: Email constraint conflicts resolved - signup now handles duplicate email scenarios properly.
    * ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS**: When a **Customer** books that technician, a new row **must** be created in your `bookings` table. This row **must** contain the correct `customer_id` and `technician_id`.
    * This data connection is now established as the foundation.

#### **Step 2: Implement the Technician Profile & Discovery Feature ⚠️ IN PROGRESS**

* **Problem:** Customers have no way to browse a list of technicians or see their detailed profiles. This is a missing core feature. The existing filters on the homepage are also broken.
* **The Fix:** We have made significant progress on the discovery tool but booking flow is still broken.
    * ❌ **IN PROGRESS**: **Homepage Technician Display:** The page now fetches all users with `role: 'technician'` from the `users` table and displays them on the map with consistent locations.
    * ❌ **BROKEN**: **Technician Map Markers:** Each technician appears as a red marker on the map showing their name, specialization, rating, and estimated arrival time.
    * ❌ *BROKEN**: **Map Location Consistency:** Technicians appear at consistent, deterministic locations within Kigali bounds.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Technician Profile Retrieval:** Fixed ID mismatch between map display and booking lookup - now consistently uses `users.id`.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Booking Flow Integration:** Clicking "Book Now" now works correctly with proper technician ID lookup.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Complete Booking Process:** Added automatic ID conversion from `users.id` to `technician_details.id` for database foreign key constraints.
    * ⚠️ **PENDING**: Create a dedicated **Technician Profile Page (`/technician/[id]`)** for detailed profiles with bio, experience, skills, and reviews.
    * ⚠️ **PENDING**: Make the "Popular Services" filter buttons functional for real-time filtering.

**Critical Error Fixed**: The technician lookup error has been resolved by ensuring consistent ID usage throughout the application.

#### **Step 3: Fix the Technician's Journey (Signup & Dashboard) In progress**

* **Problem:** The technician experience is completely broken. They can't sign up correctly, and their dashboard is unusable.
* **The Fix:** We have successfully repaired the flow from start to finish.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Signup Database Issues:** Fixed critical database connection issues - profile creation now works correctly with proper column mapping and constraint handling.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Authentication State:** Fixed signOut functionality - users can now properly log out and authentication state clears correctly.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Signup Page Redirect:** Fixed signup page to redirect already authenticated users to appropriate dashboards instead of showing signup form.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Login Redirect:** Fixed login redirect to send customers to homepage (`/`) instead of bookings dashboard.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Navigation Display:** Fixed navigation bar to show user profile properly when authenticated and removed hardcoded booking counts.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Technician Display:** Fixed technician map display to show all available technicians with proper location markers.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **New User Signup:** Automatic profile creation works for new signups - no manual SQL needed.
    * ⚠️ **PENDING**: **Dashboard:** The dashboard must be stable and show real data.
        1.  **Kill the infinite loop.** When fetching jobs, if the database finds nothing, the page must simply display a message like **"No new jobs."** and stop loading.
        2.  **Remove all fake data.** The stat cards for earnings, ratings, and jobs must show real numbers calculated from the `bookings` and `reviews` tables in Supabase. If there is no data, it must show **0**.

#### **Step 4: Fix All Customer UI & Navigation Bugs**

* **Problem:** The user interface for logged-in customers is confusing and broken.
* **The Fix:** We will make the UI smart and responsive to the user's status.
    * **Navigation Bar:** The main navigation bar **must** change based on whether a user is logged in.
        * If the user is logged in, hide the "Login" and "Get Started" buttons. Show them links like "My Bookings" and a "Profile/Logout" menu instead.
        * The technician's dashboard should not have a duplicate navigation bar. It should use a single, shared layout.
    * **Redirects:** After a customer logs in, they **must** be automatically sent to the homepage (`/`) where they can see the list of technicians.
