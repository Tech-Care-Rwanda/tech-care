**Our Core Goal:** To create a stable, end-to-end experience where a Customer can find, view, and book a Technician, and the Technician can see and manage that booking. This plan fixes all known UI bugs and implements the core technician profile feature.

#### **Step 1: Build the Core Data Connection ⚠️ MOSTLY COMPLETE**

* **Problem:** This is the most important issue. There is no reliable data link between what a technician does and what a customer sees. A new technician signs up but doesn't appear for customers. A customer books a job, but the technician never sees it. The system is disconnected.
* **The Fix:** We established a "single source of truth" in the database that everything else uses.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: When a new **Technician** signs up, a row is now created in the `users` table in Supabase with their details and proper role. 
    * ✅ **FIXED**: Database schema issues resolved - code now uses correct table names (`users` instead of `profiles`, `bookings` instead of `jobs`).
    * ✅ **FIXED**: Column name mismatch resolved - authentication now uses `users.id` correctly instead of non-existent `user_id` column.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: Email constraint conflicts resolved - signup now handles duplicate email scenarios properly.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Technician Dashboard Display**: Dashboard now successfully fetches and displays all bookings from Supabase database.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Booking Status Updates**: Accept/Decline buttons work - status changes locally and attempts database sync.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **UI Functionality**: All TypeScript errors resolved, proper error handling, toast notifications working.
    * ⚠️ **PENDING VERIFICATION**: Database sync verification - local status updates work, but need to confirm database row updates are persisting correctly.
    * ✅ **VERIFIED**: When a **Customer** books that technician, a new row **is** created in your `bookings` table with correct `customer_id` and `technician_id`.

#### **Step 2: Implement the Technician Profile & Discovery Feature ✅ COMPLETE**

* **Problem:** Customers have no way to browse a list of technicians or see their detailed profiles. This is a missing core feature. The existing filters on the homepage are also broken.
* **The Fix:** We have successfully implemented a complete technician discovery and profile system.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Homepage Technician Display:** Page now properly fetches all users with `role: 'TECHNICIAN'` from database and displays them. Removed mock data fallback - shows real data only.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Technician Map Markers:** Map component properly displays technicians as markers with name, specialization, rating, and estimated arrival time. Enhanced with better error handling and debugging.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Map Location Consistency:** Technicians appear at consistent, deterministic locations within Kigali bounds using hash-based coordinate generation.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Technician Profile Retrieval:** Fixed ID mismatch between map display and booking lookup - now consistently uses `users.id`.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Booking Flow Integration:** Clicking "Book Now" now works correctly with proper technician ID lookup.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Complete Booking Process:** Added automatic ID conversion from `users.id` to `technician_details.id` for database foreign key constraints.
    * ✅ **COMPLETE**: **Technician Profile Page (`/technician/[id]`):** Created comprehensive profile pages showing detailed technician information, bio, experience, skills, ratings, contact info, and booking options.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Popular Services Filter:** Filter buttons are now fully functional for real-time filtering based on technician specializations.

**Result:** Customers can now discover technicians on the homepage map, filter by services, view detailed profiles, and book services seamlessly. The entire technician discovery flow is complete and production-ready.

#### **Step 3: Fix the Technician's Journey (Signup & Dashboard) ✅ COMPLETE**

* **Problem:** The technician experience is completely broken. They can't sign up correctly, and their dashboard is unusable.
* **The Fix:** We have successfully repaired the flow from start to finish.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Signup Database Issues:** Fixed critical database connection issues - profile creation now works correctly with proper column mapping and constraint handling.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Authentication State:** Fixed signOut functionality - users can now properly log out and authentication state clears correctly.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Signup Page Redirect:** Fixed signup page to redirect already authenticated users to appropriate dashboards instead of showing signup form.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Login Redirect:** Fixed login redirect to send customers to homepage (`/`) instead of bookings dashboard.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Navigation Display:** Fixed navigation bar to show user profile properly when authenticated and removed hardcoded booking counts.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **Technician Display:** Fixed technician map display to show all available technicians with proper location markers.
    * ✅ **FIXED**: **New User Signup:** Automatic profile creation works for new signups - no manual SQL needed.
    * ✅ **COMPLETE**: **Dashboard:** The dashboard is now stable and shows real data.
        1. ✅ **FIXED**: **Infinite Loop Killed:** Dashboard properly handles empty states with "No pending requests" message.
        2. ✅ **FIXED**: **Real Data Only:** All stat cards show real numbers from database - earnings, ratings, jobs from `bookings` and `reviews` tables. Shows **0** when no data exists.
        3. ✅ **FIXED**: **Profile Management:** Technician profile page works with proper save functionality and error handling.
