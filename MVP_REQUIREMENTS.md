# TechCare MVP - Core Requirements Only

**CRITICAL RULE: NEVER USE MOCK DATA. ALL DATA MUST COME FROM THE DATABASE.**

## What We're Building (MVP Only)

A basic technician booking platform where:
1. Users can see technicians on a map ‚úÖ
2. Users can click technicians to see details and book
3. Technicians have dashboards to manage bookings  
4. Complete booking system flow works end-to-end

## Current Status ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Frontend-Database Connection**: Direct Supabase connection working
- **Map System**: Shows real technicians from Supabase with GPS coordinates
- **Technician Data**: Real 5 technicians in Kigali with specializations
- **No Mock Data**: All mock/demo data removed, shows empty states when no data
- **UI Components**: Map, cards, buttons, profile dropdown working
- **Database**: Supabase with tables: users, technician_details, bookings (empty), reviews

## User Flow Design

### Customer Journey:
1. **Find Technicians** (Working ‚úÖ) ‚Üí Map shows real technicians  
2. **Filter Services** (Broken ‚ùå) ‚Üí Popular Services buttons filter map
3. **Select & Book** (Missing ‚ùå) ‚Üí Click technician ‚Üí Book Now ‚Üí Form ‚Üí Confirmation

- **technician_details**: id, user_id, specialization, experience, rate, is_available, latitude, longitude  
- **bookings**: (exists but empty - needs proper structure)
- **reviews**: (exists)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Popular Services filtering works perfectly
- [ ] User can book a technician through complete flow

- [ ] Zero mock data anywhere in the system

## What NOT to Build (MVP)

- Analytics, multi-language support, mobile app
- Payment processing (just track bookings)
