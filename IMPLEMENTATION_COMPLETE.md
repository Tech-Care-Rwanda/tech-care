## 🔧 Environment Configuration

### For your `.env.local` file (frontend):
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_VERSION="v1"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="your-google-maps-api-key-here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY="your-google-places-api-key-here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV="development"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION="1.0.0"
```

### For backend `.env` file:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/techcare"
JWT_SECRET="techcare-super-secret-jwt-key-2024-development-only"
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV="development"
CORS_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3001,http://localhost:3000"
