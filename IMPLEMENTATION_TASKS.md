1. **Task 1.1 must be completed first** - Everything else depends on proper data foundation
2. **Phase 2 tasks should be done in parallel** after Phase 1 completion
3. **Testing should happen continuously**, not just at the end

### Risk Mitigation
- Test each task thoroughly before moving to next
- Keep database backups before making schema changes
- Use feature flags for major UI changes
- Have rollback plan for each deployment

### Resource Requirements
- **Total Estimated Time:** 15-20 development days
- **Database Access:** Full Supabase admin access required
- **Testing Environment:** Staging environment recommended
- **Code Review:** All critical path changes should be reviewed
